# Getting Started <a name="Getting-Started"></a>
This repository is arranged as submodules so you can either pull all the tutorials or simply the ones you want. 
To pull all the tutorials run:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/ai
```

if you have git older than 2.13 run:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/ai.git
```

To pull a single submodule (e.g. DeployDeepModelKubernetes) run:
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ai
cd ai
git submodule init submodules/DeployDeepModelKubernetes
git submodule update
```
